## Explain the Various Phases Of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) ?
A software life cycle model (also termed process model) is a pictorial and diagrammatic representation of the software life cycle. A life cycle model represents all the methods required to make a software product transit through its life cycle stages. It also captures the structure in which these methods are to be undertaken.

In other words, a life cycle model maps the various activities performed on a software product from its inception to retirement. Different life cycle models may plan the necessary development activities to phases in different ways. Thus, no element which life cycle model is followed, the essential activities are contained in all life cycle models though the action may be carried out in distinct orders in different life cycle models. During any life cycle stage, more than one activity may also be carried out.

### The various phases are:

#### **Stage1: Planning and requirement analysis
Requirement Analysis is the most important and necessary stage in SDLC.
The senior members of the team perform it with inputs from all the stakeholders and domain experts or SMEs in the industry.
Planning for the quality assurance requirements and identifications of the risks associated with the projects is also done at this stage.

#### **Stage2:  Defining Requirements
Once the requirement analysis is done, the next stage is to certainly represent and document the software requirements and get them accepted from the project stakeholders.
This is accomplished through "SRS"- Software Requirement Specification document which contains all the product requirements to be constructed and developed during the project life cycle.

#### **Stage3:  Designing the Software
The next phase is about to bring down all the knowledge of requirements, analysis, and design of the software project. This phase is the product of the last two, like inputs from the customer and requirement gathering.

#### **Stage4:  Developing the project
In this phase of SDLC, the actual development begins, and the programming is built. The implementation of design begins concerning writing code. Developers have to follow the coding guidelines described by their 
management and programming tools like compilers, interpreters, debuggers, etc. are used to develop and implement the code.

#### **Stage5: Testing
After the code is generated, it is tested against the requirements to make sure that the products are solving the needs addressed and gathered during the requirements stage.
During this stage, unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing are done.

#### **Stage6: Deployment
Once the software is certified, and no bugs or errors are stated, then it is deployed.
Then based on the assessment, the software may be released as it is or with suggested enhancement in the object segment.
After the software is deployed, then its maintenance begins.


#### **Stage7: Maintainance
Once when the client starts using the developed systems, then the real issues come up and requirements to be solved from time to time.
This procedure where the care is taken for the developed product is known as maintenance.
